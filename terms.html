                <h2>1. Payments</h2>
                <p>
                    1.1. An agreement is established in relation to the payment of a project, where 50% of the estimated value must be paid at

                    development of the project.</p>
                <p>1.3. The payment calendar can be negotiated in order to minimize the initial investment load, and to facilitate
                    the project’s progress.

                <p>1.4. Items with monthly or annual expiration will be billed one month in advance, within a maximum period

                    2. Schedules and Delivery Times</h2>
                <p> 2.1. The estimated timeframe is a mere indicator of the number of expected necessary hours, and will depend

                </p>
                <p>2.2. The delivery date of each phase will always depend on the correct and timely delivery of all content

                <p>2.3. The delivery dates agreed by the two parties, can and will only be respected when there are no delays

                    or review of the work done, will result in the issuance of a new invoice, according to the established
                    hourly rate, for the hours of development up to that time. </p>
                <br>
